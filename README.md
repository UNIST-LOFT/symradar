# SymRadar
<!-- ![fig](./etc/symradar.png) -->
SymRadar is a patch verification tool for vulnerability repair.
SymRadar performs patch verification by covering near the ciritical input-space area by extracting concrete snapshot and construct abstract snapshot to enable symbolic execution.
This repository contains implementation of SymRadar: PoC-Centered Bounded Verification for Vulnerability Repair (ICSE '26) and experiment scripts.


## Directory Structure
### symradar
This is our main technical contribution.
It contains KLEE-based symbolic execution tool which supports under-constrained symbolic execution and lazy initialization.
It can handle concrete snapshot extraction, abstract snapshot construction from concrete snapshot, and patch verification based on UC-SE and lazy initialization. Several optimizations and heuristics are applied to support such features.

### Benchmarks
#### CPR
[CPR](https://cpr-tool.github.io/) is a automated vulnerability repair tool that generate patches for vulnerable program.
CPR's output is our main patch validation target.
This directory contains benchmarks and scripts for experiments.


## Getting Started
This is example with one subject. Check [CPR directory](./CPR) to run full experiments.
### 1. Docker image for experiments
```shell
docker pull hsh814/symradar:2025-12-24
docker run -d -it --name symradar hsh814/symradar:2025-12-24 bash
```

### 2. Running a simple example (libjpeg/CVE-2018-19664)
```shell
cd /root/projects/CPR
# 1. Compile patches generated by CPR
sympatch.py single /root/projects/CPR/patches/extractfix/libjpeg/CVE-2018-19664/concrete
# 2. Build target programs
symutil.py build 19664
# 3. Run target program with concrete input to collect plausible patches
symradar.py filter 19664
# 4. Extract concrete snapshot
symradar.py snapshot 19664 -p high
# 5. Construct abstract snapshot and run symbolic execution
symradar.py run 19664 -p high
```
1. CPR generated patches are stored in `CPR/patches/extractfix/libjpeg/CVE-2018-19664/concrete/uni_klee_runtime_new.c`. Use `sympatch.py` to compile them.
2. You also need to build target programs into LLVM bitcode, which is required for symbolic execution. This can be done by `symutil.py build`.
3. Before running experiment, you need to identify plausible patches from given patches. `symradar.py filter` will do the work.
4. Use `symradar.py snapshot` to extract concrete snapshot from given exploit.
5. Run `symradar.py run` to execute SymRadar. It first construct abstract snapshot from concrete snapshot, and run symbolic execution.


Expected output (in `/root/projects/CPR/patches/extractfix/libjpeg/CVE-2018-19664/patched`):
```
patched
|-- djpeg
|-- djpeg.bc
|-- exploit.jpg
|-- filter/
|-- high-0/
|-- snapshot-high/
```
`filter` directory contains list of plausible patches in `filter/filtered.json`. 
`snapshot-high` contains a concrete snapshot in (`snapshot-high/snapshot-last.json`).
`high-0` is a directory containing experiment results.

### 3. Analyzing the results
```
symradar.py analyze 19664 -p high
```
You can look `patched/high-0/table_v3.sbsv` file to get experiment result.
